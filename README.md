# BECMonitor v 0.2
Monitor for Spinor BEC Experiment in Paul Lett's sodium Lab.  Meant to integrate with SetList, a BEC control system written at the Joint Quantum Institute.

This code communicates with the experimental control system and allows flexible fitting
and other analysis routines on every shot of a cold atom experiment.  

## Usage
1. Clone the repository on your desktop.  
2. Edit the experiment.config file in the main directory (you shouldn't need to enter the BECMonitor subdirectory of BECMonitor)
3. Run the startup.py file
4. Send comments and questions to zachg@umd.edu


### Future Additions
* Direct camera control
* Feedback to experimental control system such as genetic algorithm for parameter optimization
